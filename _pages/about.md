Hello! I am a robotics researcher, mainly working with Model Predictive Control (MPC) applied to Robotics. I have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, when I worked with Stochastic MPC (SMPC) for legged robots.

In the industry, I have worked on the development of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) for load transportation at warehouses. 

During my bachelor, I worked with quadrotors, sumo, and micromouse robots.

I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LucasSchulzeRobotics), where I post tutorials related to robotics that may help you.

I also have an introductory course in Portuguese about Robot Operating System (ROS). For more information about the course, please check [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/introducao-ao-robot-operating-system-ros/?referralCode=21AB9DA48C1CCDE97F87).

If you think I can help you, then please do not hesitate to get in touch.
