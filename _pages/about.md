Hello! My name is Lucas Schulze and I am passionate about robotics. My research focus is Model Predictive Control (MPC) applied to robotics, working with Explicit MPC (eMPC) and Stochastic MPC (SMPC). In the industry, I have worked on the development of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) for warehouses. I already worked with quadrotors, sumo robots, maze, Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), and quadruped robots.
